Here's a simple implementation of a login, logout, and registration system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This example doesn't include server-side authentication but simulates the process with local storage for demonstration purposes.
HTML (index.html)

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Login, Logout, and Register</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./src/Component/Form/form.css">

<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1 id="formTitle">Register</h1>
        <form id="authForm">
            <input type="text" id="username" placeholder="Username" required>
            <input type="password" id="password" placeholder="Password" required>
            <button type="submit">Register</button>
        </form>
        <p id="switchForm">Already have an account? <a href="#" id="switchToLogin">Login here</a></p>
        <div id="userArea" class="hidden">
            <h2>Welcome, <span id="loggedInUser"></span>!</h2>
            <button id="logoutButton">Logout</button>
        </div>
    </div>


    <script src="./src/Component/Form/form.js"></script>
</body>
</html>



Explanation
* HTML: Creates a form for registration and login with a toggle link to switch between them. It includes a welcome area for logged-in users.
* CSS: Styles the form and buttons for a clean, user-friendly interface.
* JavaScript:
   * Handles form submissions for both registration and login.
   * Uses local storage to store user credentials (for demonstration purposes only).
   * Provides feedback to users and manages the visibility of the login/registration form and the user area.
How to Run the Code
1. Create three files: index.html, styles.css, and script.js.
2. Copy the respective code into each file.
3. Open index.html in a web browser to test the functionality.
This is a simple example and should be expanded with proper validation and security measures for real-world applications.
